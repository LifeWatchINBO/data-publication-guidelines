## Terms we seldom use

* [ ] `references` would contain a public URL with more information about an occurrence, and we don't have those
* [ ] `informationWithheld` could be `see metata`, where it is described in additional information

## Terms we don't use

This is not a full list, just terms we might have populated before.

* [ ] `modified` seldom reflects all modifications, such as altered mapping
* [ ] `bibliographicCitation` is the citation of a dataset, which is in the metadata and too bulky to repeat for every occurrence
* [ ] `country` is not used, we use `countryCode`
* [ ] `locality` is not used, as our vocabularies only apply to `municipality` and higher, or `waterBody`
* [ ] `dateIdentified` is assumed to be the `eventDate` and is thus not populated
* [ ] `identificationReferences` is almost never known
* [ ] `verbatimTaxonRank` is not used since we only have regular `taxonRank`s
* [ ] `originalNameUsage` is reserved for checklists
* [ ] `taxonomicStatus` is reserved for checklists

## Specialized datasets

### Specimen records

Populate the following terms:

* [ ] `type` is `PhysicalObject`
* [ ] `basisOfRecord` is `PreservedSpecimen`
* [ ] `collectionCode` refers to the collection acronym
* [ ] `catalogNumber` refers to the ID on the specimen

### Tracking data

Try to populate these terms:

* [ ] `organismID` the code for the indivual
* [ ] `organismName` the name of the individual
* [ ] `minimumElevationInMeters` is `0`
* [ ] `minimumDistanceAboveSurfaceInMeters` is the recorded flight altitude

The following mandatory terms cannot be populated:

* [ ] `recordedBy`

* [ ] `countryCode`

## Event core

Try to populate these terms:


* [ ] `parentEventID`
* [ ] `sampleSizeValue`
* [ ] `sampleSizeUnit`
* [ ] `eventRemarks`
