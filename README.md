# Open biodiversity data publication by the INBO

## Rationale

One of our missions is to unlock the **biodiversity data** managed by the Research Institute for Nature and Forest ([INBO](http://www.inbo.be)): both existing datasets and data collected through our terrestrial and freshwater observatories for the [LifeWatch research infrastructure](http://lifewatch.inbo.be/blog/pages/about.html). The bulk of these data are occurrence and checklist data, which we publish as open, standardized, well-documented, [GBIF-registered](http://www.gbif.org) [Darwin Core Archives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Core_Archive) on our [GBIF Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT)](http://data.inbo.be/ipt).

This repository is where we document data publication guidelines and track issues for our published and to be published datasets. Note that this is a work in progress. If you have questions or remarks, [leave an issue](https://github.com/inbo/data-publication/issues), contact us at [@LifeWatchINBO](https://twitter.com/LifeWatchINBO) or opendata@inbo.be.
